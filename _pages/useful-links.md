These are some useful links, tools and random stuff I found across the web (or someone suggested me at some point). Feel free to explore it :).

--------
* **uv:** a pip replacement, but tons of times faster.
    * [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
* **Tectonic:** a faster and more efficient LaTeX engine that installs only the dependencies you need. I've experienced some minor issues with weird packages (such as fonts), but it's overall very decent -- and most important, faster than standard TeXLive.
    * [https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/)
* **Professor Jorge Stolfi's webpage:** just trust me and check it.
    * [https://ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/](https://ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/)
* **Rectangle:** a very clever tool for window management in macOS, even better than the standard from Tahoe.
    * [https://https://rectangleapp.com/](https://https://rectangleapp.com/)
* **Dontpad:** share instant notes through URLs. No registration, no forms, nothing. Just flawless.
    * [https://dontpad.com/](https://dontpad.com/)
* **BitWarden:** my preferred password manager.
    * [https://bitwarden.com/](https://bitwarden.com/)
* **ISGC:** a huge website with useful information of almost every existing graph class.
    * [https://www.graphclasses.org/](https://www.graphclasses.org/)
* **Excalidraw:** a tool for drawing everything you can imagine inside your browser. No registration needed and everything is stored into your browser's local storage.
    * [https://excalidraw.com/](https://excalidraw.com/)
* **Wordle:** come on, you already know it.
    * [https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)
* **VSCodium:** a VSCode, but without Microsoft's spyware (it's FOSS).
    * [https://vscodium.com/](https://vscodium.com/)
